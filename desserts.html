    <h2>Barfi</h2>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> A soft, milky dessert made in various styles across Pakistan.</p>
      <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Khoya, sugar, cardamom, nuts.</p>
      <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> To make Barfi, start by taking 2 cups of khoya and cooking it in a non-stick pan over low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Once the khoya softens slightly, add ¾ cup of sugar and ½ teaspoon of cardamom powder. Continue stirring the mixture until it thickens and begins to leave the sides of the pan, forming a soft dough-like texture. Turn off the heat and quickly transfer the mixture into a greased plate or tray. Flatten the surface evenly using a spatula, and if you like, sprinkle some chopped almonds or pistachios on top, along with edible silver leaf for decoration. Let it cool completely, then cut into square or diamond-shaped pieces and serve.

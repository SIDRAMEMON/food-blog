      <h2>Paya</h2>
 <p><strong>History:</strong> Paya, a slow cooked stew made with lamb or goat trotters, has its roots in the kitchens of South Asia, particularly in the Indian subcontinent. It's believed to have originated in the Mughal courts, where chefs perfected the art of utilizing less expensive cuts like trotters to create flavorful dishes. Over time, paya became a popular breakfast staple in regions like Punjab</p>
  <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>The primary ingredient for Paye, a traditional Punjabi dish, is mutton or beef trotters (feet), also known as paya. Other essential ingredients include a blend of aromatic spices, ginger, garlic, onions, and sometimes yogurt or tomatoes. </p>
<p><strong>Recipe:</strong> To make a traditional and flavorful paye dish, start by thoroughly cleaning the trotters (paye) with warm water and a little vinegar or flour to remove any odor or residue. In a large pot, heat oil and sauté finely sliced onions until they turn golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears. Then add the cleaned trotters and fry them well with the masala for several minutes to seal in the flavor. Stir in whisked yogurt along with turmeric, red chili powder, salt, and optional garam masala. Mix everything thoroughly and add enough water to cover the trotters. Cover the pot and let it simmer on very low heat for several hours—traditionally 4 to 6 hours—or until the trotters become tender and release their natural gelatin, creating a rich, sticky gravy. Alternatively, you can use a pressure cooker for faster results. Once done, garnish with freshly chopped coriander and thin ginger slices. </p>

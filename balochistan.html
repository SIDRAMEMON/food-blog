       <h2>Sajji</h2>
      <p><strong>History:</strong>Sajji originated from the Balochi tribes. Traditionally, it is prepared with whole lamb or chicken, skewered and cooked over open flames or in clay ovens.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>Key ingredients include whole chicken, salt, vinegar, and a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, black pepper, and optionally, carom seeds, green cardamom, and cinnamon. The marinade also typically includes ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, and oil. 
  <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> For this simple yet flavorful roast meat dish, the meat (usually chicken or mutton) is first cleaned and then marinated with just salt and freshly squeezed lemon juice. This minimal seasoning allows the natural flavor of the meat to shine through. The marinated meat is left to rest for at least an hour, allowing the lemon to tenderize it. It is then slow-roasted—either in the oven, on a stovetop, or over an open flame—until the outside becomes beautifully crispy and golden, while the inside remains juicy and tender. The result is a delicious, aromatic roast that’s full of natural flavor without needing heavy spices. It’s commonly served with naan, roti, or steamed rice</p>

      <h2>Balochi Tikka</h2>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> A spicy meat dish prepared in Balochistan during gatherings and celebrations. Traditionally grilled on skewers over charcoal.</p>

      <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Balochi tikka is a flavorful dish featuring marinated and grilled chicken pieces. Key ingredients include chicken, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, and a blend of spices like coriander, cumin, red chili flakes, and garam masala. Lemon juice, oil, and sometimes kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) are also used. </p>
      <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> To prepare this flavorful chicken tikka, boneless or bone-in chicken pieces are first marinated in a rich mixture of thick yogurt, crushed spices (like cumin, coriander, and red chili), freshly squeezed lemon juice, salt, and a spoonful of mustard oil, which adds a deep, smoky richness. The marinated chicken is then left to rest for a few hours—or preferably overnight—so the flavors deeply infuse into the meat. Once marinated, the chicken is cooked slowly over hot charcoal or grilled until it becomes juicy, tender, and slightly charred at the edges, giving it that signature tikka texture. For an authentic smoky touch, a piece of hot coal is placed in the cooking pot with the chicken, a few drops of oil are added on top, and the pot is sealed briefly to let the smoke infuse the meat. This simple yet aromatic trick enhances the overall flavor. Chicken tikka is best served hot with naan, spiced rice, or fresh salad, along with mint chutney or raita on the side.</p>

      <h2>Landhi</h2>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> Landhi, a traditional Balochi dish, is a type of cured meat, specifically dried lamb or mutton, that is a winter delicacy in Balochistan, Pakistan, and parts of Afghanistan. Its history is rooted in the region's extreme climate and nomadic lifestyle, where preserving food was essential for survival.</p>
      <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> The primary ingredient is lamb, which is slaughtered, skinned, roasted to melt the fat, and then marinated with salt and herbs. After marinating, it's dried, traditionally in the sun for several weeks. This process preserves the meat, making it a staple during the cold winter months. </p>
      <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> In this traditional preservation method, meat—usually beef or mutton—is marinated with salt, turmeric, and a blend of local spices to naturally preserve it without the need for refrigeration. The spiced meat is then left to dry under the sun for several days, allowing it to lose moisture and develop a deep, concentrated flavor. Once fully dried, the meat can be stored for weeks and is later cooked slowly over low heat. This slow-cooking process helps rehydrate the meat slightly while intensifying its rich, earthy taste. It is usually prepared with very little oil and sometimes just a splash of water, keeping the dish simple and true to its roots. </p>

      <h2>Roosh (Balochi Beef Curry)</h2>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> Rosh, also known as Namkeen Gosht, is a traditional Balochi dish, primarily featuring slow-cooked lamb or mutton. Its history is deeply rooted in the Balochistan and Pashtun regions of Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. The dish is characterized by its rich, salty flavor, achieved through a salting and slow-cooking process, often with minimal additional spices. </p>
      <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>mutton or beef, along with onions, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and spices like black pepper and salt. Some variations include potatoes, green chilies, and various whole spices like cinnamon and cloves. </p>
      <p><strong>Recipe:</strong> made with lamb or beef, cooked slowly in its own fat and bones. It is seasoned simply with salt, black pepper, and garlic to keep the flavor natural and rich. The meat is simmered on low flame until it's extremely tender and juicy. Traditionally, it is cooked in a deep pot and never stirred too much. Rosh is best enjoyed with naan or rice, especially in Baloch gatherings.</p>
